    Getting impatient, I grab his face and slam his lips into mine. He freezes up a little, seemingly unsure on what to do before settling on letting his hands roam somewhere around my back."

    He pulls up his long skirt, finally revealing his legs and the stockings that were hidden under there. It’s certainly prettier than I thought, and the garter just made him look extra hot."
    MC "Holy shit, you’re incredible."
    TSM "R-really?"
    MC  You’re so pretty!"

    MC "10 out 10 that’s for sure!"
    MC "You bought this even when you thought I didn’t like you back?"

    With that I climbed on top of him to give him another kiss, our bodies pressed together for warmth. Unbelievably soft sounds escaping his lips."

    He responds in kind, moving his arms around my back, holding me like a dream that might disappear any minute."
